# Useful PulseSPELs for measuring RIDME

## Variable definitions

## Experiments

1. *Ref_RIDME*: a simple 1D RIDME experiment with no ESEEM averaging
2. *Ref_RIDME_vs_d4*: a 2D RIDME experiment with scanning of the mixing time (d4) and with no ESEEM averaging. In the given version, the mixing time doubles at every slice along the 2nd dimension.
3. *Ref_RIDME_avd1d2*: a 1D RIDME experiment with ESEEM averaging
4. *Ref_RIDME_avd1d2_vsd4*: a 2D RIDME experiment with scanning of the mixing time (d4) and with ESEEM averaging. In the given version, the mixing time doubles at every slice along the 2nd dimension.
